# Welcome

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

I'm Dustin, a Fullstack Software Engineer with 7 years of experience!

I'm a Functional Developer at heart, and my most used toolset/language is JavaScript. I've authored many cool and fun libraries for the language!

I'm always looking to expand my horizons though and I've been delving little by little into other languages like Haskell, Clojure, Elm, and Scheme/Racket!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, check out my toolsets and feel free to ask questions/open issues/contibute where you see fit.
